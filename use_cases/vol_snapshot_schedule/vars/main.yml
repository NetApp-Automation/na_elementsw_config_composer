#Vars file for creating snapshots and snapshot schedule

#Enter the list of volume snapshots to be created
#Each volume snapshot takes the ID or name of the volume and account which is attached to the volume
#Entering the name of the snapshot is optional. If no name is given, the date and time of creation of snapshot is taken as name of snapshot by default
#Enter the retention period of snapshot. It is optional parameter. If not specified, by default, the snapshot will be retained forever.
#Retention takes the form of HH:MM:SS. Ensure you enter the value in quotes. Eg: For 2 days, enter retention value "48:00:00"

#Enter the list of details for creating snapshot schedule
#Each snapshot schedule takes the name, type of snapshot schedule, account and volume that is to be attached to the snapshot schedule
#Enter the details of when and in what interval should the snapshots be taken
#'volumes' can be name or ID of the volumes to be attached to snapshot schedule. It takes a list of volumes
#'account' will be the name or ID of account to be attached to snapshot schedule
#'snap_schedule_type' can be DaysOfWeekFrequency, DaysOfMonthFrequency, TimeIntervalFrequency
#'days_of_month' are the dates of each month when the snapshot is to be taken. It takes a list of numerical values from 1-31.
#'days_of_month' is to be defined only when the 'snap_schedule_type' is equal to 'DaysOfMonthFrequency'. In other cases, 'days_of_month' should be commented
#'days_of_week' are the days of each week when the snapshot is to be taken. It takes a list of values from Sunday to Saturday
#'days_of_week' is to be defined only when the 'snap_schedule_type' is equal to 'DaysOfWeekFrequency'. In other cases, 'days_of_week' should be commented
#'time_interval_in_days' defines the interval in days after which the snapshot be taken. It takes numerical values
#'time_interval_in_days' is to be defined only when the 'snap_schedule_type' is equal to 'TimeIntervalFrequency' and you wish to have the schedule run every 'x' days. Default value is '0'.
#In other cases, 'time_interval_in_days' must be commented
#'time_interval_in_hours' can be defined only when the 'snap_schedule_type' is equal to 'TimeIntervalFrequency' and you wish to have the schedule run every 'x' hours. Default value is '0'. It takes numerical values
#In other cases, 'time_interval_in_hours' must be commented
#'time_interval_in_minutes' can be defined only when the 'snap_schedule_type' is equal to 'TimeIntervalFrequency' and you wish to have the schedule run every 'x' minutes. Default value is '0'. It takes numerical values
#In other cases, 'time_interval_in_minutes' must be commented
#You can either use 'time_interval_in_days' or 'time_interval_in_hours' or 'time_interval_in_minutes'. You cannot use any of the two together.
#'schedule_start_date' defines the start date of the snapshot schedule. The format is <YYYY-MM-DD>T<HH:MM:SS>Z. Eg: 2020-08-01T12:00:00Z
#Enter the retention period of snapshot. It is optional parameter. If not specified, by default, the snapshot will be retained forever.
#Retention takes the form of HH:MM:SS. Ensure you enter the value in quotes. Eg: For 2 days, enter retention value "48:00:00"
