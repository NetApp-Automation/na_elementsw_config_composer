#Enter the node name or node ID whose drives are to be added to the cluster.
#If you want to add all drives of all nodes to the cluster, leave the variable 'nodes' commented
#If you want to add drives of a specific node to the cluster, uncomment the 'nodes' variable and list the node names or node-ids of the specific nodes

  - mip: x.x.x.x
    sip: x.x.x.x

#Subnet mask for Storage IPs on HCI nodes
#Enter the value in x.x.x.x format
